# Optimizing_Portfolio
This repository contains a project focused on portfolio optimization by implementing a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) model. The primary goal is to construct an optimal investment portfolio based on companies' daily closing prices over a specific period.

Data Collection: Gather daily closing prices for a selection of companies over a defined time frame.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
MAD Model Implementation: Apply the Mean Absolute Deviation model to minimize the risk and determine the optimal portfolio.
Optimal Portfolio Construction: Generate an optimal portfolio allocation that minimizes risk and maximizes potential returns.
Visualization: Visualize the performance and risk of the optimized portfolio compared to other potential portfolios.
